Title: Optimistic Circular Binary Segmentation
Version: 1.0
Author: Tobias Castelberg
Maintainer: <castelberg.tobias@gmail.com>
Description: Accelerates circular binary segmentation by using optimistic search strategies i.e. reducing the amount of evaluations of the CUSUM statistics. Also extended to L1 loss for a change point detection procedure more robust to outliers.
    A closer explanation is given in the papers "A near-linear time variant for Circular Binary Segmentation using Optimistic Search" and "Algorithms for fast, robust and multivariate Circular Binary Segmentation variants".
