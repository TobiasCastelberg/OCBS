\usage{
CheckValid(
  X,
  bd = NULL,
  optimization = "L2",
  method = "advanced",
  select = "mixed",
  alpha = 0.01,
  nr_perms = 10000,
  circular = T,
  min_seg = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{data matrix}

\item{bd}{stopping boundary for early stopping}

\item{optimization}{minimization of "L1" or "L2" loss}

\item{method}{"advanced" or "full" search}

\item{select}{Model selection approach "perm" (permutation test only), "mixed"
(first Wilcoxon test, then permutation test), "wilc" (Wilcoxon test only)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for testing change points}

\item{nr_perms}{Number of permutation for permutation tests}

\item{circular}{\code{circular = T} does CBS, else the test will be for BS}

\item{min_seg}{minimal segment length. Note that change points still can be
closer together than \code{min_seg}}
}
\value{
list containing whether the change points are valid or not and the
corresponding candidates. For (non-circular) BS, there is only one potential
change point, which is stored in \code{t}. In that case \code{s=0.}
